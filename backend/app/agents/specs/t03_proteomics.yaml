few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Which proteins are differentially abundant in astronaut plasma after long-duration spaceflight?"
    expected: "Query proteomics datasets, perform differential abundance analysis, report fold-change and FDR"
  - input: "Map metabolite changes in spaceflight urine samples to KEGG pathways"
    expected: "Identify significantly altered metabolites, perform pathway enrichment, report impact scores"

failure_modes:
  - "Protein ID ambiguity from shared peptides — mitigated by protein grouping and razor peptide assignment"
  - "Metabolite misidentification from MS1-only data — mitigated by requiring MS2 confirmation"
  - "Batch effects in multi-run experiments — mitigated by reference channel normalization"
