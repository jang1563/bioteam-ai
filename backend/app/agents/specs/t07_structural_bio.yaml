few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Predict the effect of a TP53 R248W mutation on protein structure and DNA binding"
    expected: "Retrieve PDB structure, analyze mutation impact on binding interface, report RMSD and binding energy changes"
  - input: "Identify druggable binding pockets on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease"
    expected: "Analyze PDB 6LU7, identify catalytic site and allosteric pockets, report pocket volume and druggability score"

failure_modes:
  - "Low-confidence AlphaFold regions misinterpreted — mitigated by pLDDT threshold filtering"
  - "Docking score overinterpretation — mitigated by requiring ensemble docking and MM-GBSA rescoring"
  - "Missing cofactors or post-translational modifications — mitigated by explicit checking of biological assembly"
