few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Review: DEG analysis with t-test on 3 replicates, no multiple testing correction, p<0.05 threshold"
    expected: "Flag: insufficient power with n=3, missing FDR/Bonferroni correction, recommend limma-voom or DESeq2 instead of t-test"
  - input: "Check: ANOVA on 5 groups with post-hoc Tukey, Cohen's d=0.3 reported as large effect"
    expected: "Flag: Cohen's d=0.3 is small effect not large, verify Tukey assumptions, check for sphericity if repeated measures"

failure_modes:
  - "Over-flagging exploratory analyses held to confirmatory standards — mitigated by analysis-type detection"
  - "Missing domain-specific test conventions (e.g., permutation tests in genomics) — mitigated by domain context"
  - "False reassurance on underpowered studies with significant results — mitigated by power-first assessment"
