few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Check reproducibility: RNA-seq analysis with no code, GEO accession provided, R version not specified"
    expected: "FAIR: Findable (yes, GEO), Accessible (yes), Interoperable (partial), Reusable (no — missing code + environment). Verdict: needs improvement"
  - input: "Assess: Jupyter notebook with pinned dependencies, Docker image, data on Zenodo with DOI"
    expected: "FAIR: all criteria met. Code reproducible with Docker. Metadata complete. Verdict: excellent"

failure_modes:
  - "Over-penalizing early-stage exploratory work for missing FAIR elements — mitigated by stage-aware scoring"
  - "Missing field-specific data standards (e.g., MIAME for microarrays) — mitigated by domain detection"
  - "Not recognizing equivalent practices (e.g., conda env vs. Docker) — mitigated by flexible environment checks"
