few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Finding: TP53 upregulated 100-fold in healthy tissue with no stress stimulus"
    expected: "Flag: implausible — TP53 100x upregulation without stress/damage stimulus suggests artifact or contamination"
  - input: "Claim: spaceflight activates NF-kB leading to muscle atrophy via inflammatory signaling"
    expected: "Plausible — NF-kB → inflammatory cytokines → muscle proteolysis is well-established; check if spaceflight NF-kB activation is supported by data"

failure_modes:
  - "Rejecting novel biology as implausible — mitigated by distinguishing 'surprising' from 'impossible'"
  - "Missing tissue-specific pathway differences — mitigated by tissue context awareness"
  - "Over-reliance on canonical pathways missing recent discoveries — mitigated by noting knowledge cutoff"
