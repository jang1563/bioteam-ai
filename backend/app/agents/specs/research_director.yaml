output_schemas:

tools:
  - route_to_specialist       # Select which specialist agent to invoke

failure_modes:
  - "Routing to wrong specialist — mitigated by classification schema + examples"
  - "Over-decomposition — too many sub-tasks — mitigated by max_steps limit"
  - "Synthesis too verbose — mitigated by output schema word limits"
