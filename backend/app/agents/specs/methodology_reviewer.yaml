few_shot_examples:
  - input: "RNAseq with n=3 per group, DESeq2, no multiple testing correction mentioned"
    expected: "sample_size_assessment: critically low n, statistical_methods: DESeq2 appropriate but MTC unclear"
  - input: "ISS experiment with ground control, 6-month duration, radiation dosimetry reported"
    expected: "controls_adequacy: good ground control, domain_specific: adequate duration and dosimetry"

failure_modes:
  - "Domain unfamiliarity: unusual methods not recognized — mitigated by broad training"
  - "Over-criticism: standard methods flagged as problematic — mitigated by calibration examples"
  - "Missing context: methods section incomplete in PDF — mitigated by supplementary check"
