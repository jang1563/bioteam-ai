few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Table contains values: SEPT7, 1-Mar, MARCH1, DEC1"
    expected: "gene_name_error: 1-Mar is likely MARCH1 corrupted by Excel"
  - input: "Mean=3.45, N=15 for Likert scale data"
    expected: "grim_failure: 3.45 is not achievable with N=15 on integer data"
  - input: "References DOI 10.1234/retracted-paper"
    expected: "retracted_reference: This paper has been retracted"

failure_modes:
  - "False positive gene names: common English words flagged — mitigated by HGNC validation and context checking"
  - "Crossref API timeout: retraction check skipped — mitigated by degradation_mode=skip"
  - "GRIM false positives on continuous data: only apply to integer-constrained scales — mitigated by LLM contextualization"
  - "Benford false alarm on small datasets: require minimum 50 values — mitigated by min_values threshold"
