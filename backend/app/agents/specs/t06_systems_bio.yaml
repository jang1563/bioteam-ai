few_shot_examples:
  - input: "What pathways are enriched in spaceflight DEGs across multiple tissues?"
    expected: "Run GO/KEGG/Reactome enrichment, identify shared pathways, report adjusted p-values and gene overlap"
  - input: "Build a gene regulatory network from multi-tissue spaceflight transcriptomics"
    expected: "Infer network using WGCNA or GENIE3, identify hub genes, detect modules, map to known pathways"

failure_modes:
  - "Enrichment bias from gene-length or expression-level — mitigated by using conditional enrichment"
  - "False hub genes from high-degree bias — mitigated by degree-corrected centrality measures"
  - "Spurious network edges from correlation-based methods — mitigated by partial correlation or mutual information"
