few_shot_examples:
  - input: "What variants in TP53 are associated with spaceflight-related clonal hematopoiesis?"
    expected: "Query WGS/WES datasets, annotate variants with ClinVar/COSMIC, report VAF and functional impact"
  - input: "Characterize DNA methylation changes in astronaut blood after 6-month ISS missions"
    expected: "Analyze WGBS data, identify DMRs, map to gene promoters, report pathway enrichment"

failure_modes:
  - "Incorrect variant annotation — mitigated by multi-database cross-referencing (ClinVar, gnomAD, COSMIC)"
  - "Epigenetic signal confounded by batch effects — mitigated by requiring biological replicates"
  - "Over-interpretation of VUS — mitigated by strict ACMG classification adherence"
