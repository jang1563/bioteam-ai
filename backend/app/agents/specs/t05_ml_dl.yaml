few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Design a classifier to predict astronaut health risk from multi-omics data"
    expected: "Recommend ensemble or multi-modal DL, specify feature selection, cross-validation, AUROC/AUPRC metrics"
  - input: "What architecture should I use for predicting protein-ligand binding from sequence?"
    expected: "Recommend transformer-based model, describe input encoding, training data, evaluation metrics"

failure_modes:
  - "Overfitting on small biological datasets — mitigated by requiring cross-validation and regularization"
  - "Data leakage from improper train/test split — mitigated by enforcing sample-level splitting"
  - "Recommending overcomplex model for tabular data — mitigated by always comparing against simple baselines"
