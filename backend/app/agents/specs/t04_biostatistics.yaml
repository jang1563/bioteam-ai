few_shot_examples:
  - input: "What statistical test should I use to compare gene expression across 3 spaceflight timepoints with repeated measures?"
    expected: "Recommend repeated-measures ANOVA or mixed-effects model, check normality/sphericity, suggest post-hoc corrections"
  - input: "How many subjects do I need to detect a 1.5-fold change in cfRNA biomarker with 80% power?"
    expected: "Compute sample size given effect size, variance, alpha=0.05, power=0.80, suggest design adjustments"

failure_modes:
  - "Recommending parametric test for non-normal data — mitigated by requiring assumption checks"
  - "Ignoring multiple testing burden — mitigated by always reporting correction method"
  - "Overconfident power estimate with uncertain variance — mitigated by sensitivity analysis"
