few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Is TNFSF11 differentially expressed in spaceflight cfRNA?"
    expected: "Query cfRNA datasets, perform DEG analysis, report fold-change and FDR"
  - input: "Screen these papers for relevance to spaceflight anemia"
    expected: "Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria, return structured screening decisions"

failure_modes:
  - "Wrong gene symbol mapping — mitigated by HGNC validation"
  - "Over-filtering during screening — mitigated by conservative thresholds"
  - "Missing metadata in extraction — mitigated by fallback to abstract parsing"
