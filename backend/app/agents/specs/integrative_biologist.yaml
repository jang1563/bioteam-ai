few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Integrate transcriptomic and proteomic spaceflight data to identify convergent pathways"
    expected: "Identify concordant/discordant genes across RNA and protein layers, map to KEGG/Reactome pathways, report confidence per layer"
  - input: "What mechanistic links connect the DNA damage and immune findings in astronaut blood samples?"
    expected: "Trace cGAS-STING pathway from DNA damage (genomics) through inflammatory signaling (transcriptomics) to cytokine levels (proteomics)"

failure_modes:
  - "False convergence from gene name collisions across species — mitigated by ortholog mapping validation"
  - "Over-interpreting sparse proteomics coverage as absence — mitigated by coverage-aware confidence scoring"
  - "Missing tissue-specific context in pathway mapping — mitigated by tissue-aware pathway databases"
