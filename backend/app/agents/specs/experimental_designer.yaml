few_shot_examples:
  - input: "Design a mouse study to test spaceflight-induced bone loss with ground controls"
    expected: "Specify flight vs. ground groups, hindlimb unloading controls, n=10/group with 80% power for 15% BMD change, block by sex and age"
  - input: "What sample size do I need for a cfRNA biomarker discovery study with 3 time points?"
    expected: "Recommend repeated-measures design, n=20/group for medium effect size, mixed-effects model, multiple testing correction"

failure_modes:
  - "Underestimating sample size for high-variance biological data — mitigated by conservative effect size estimates"
  - "Missing confounders in blocking strategy — mitigated by checklist-based confounder screening"
  - "Inappropriate test selection for non-normal data — mitigated by distribution assumption checks"
